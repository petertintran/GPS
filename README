• 1. Project Scope        *
•••••••••••••••••••••••••••
 The app is the same as before, however, new features have been added. A GPS has been 
 integrated into the app which will give the latitude and longitude of the user's current 
 location. After obtaining this information the user can then calculate the sunrise and 
 sunset of the location they are at. An index has been incorporated into the app which 
 allows for easier navigation through the list of cities for a specific state

 To build and run the application the file: SunriseSunset.xcodeproj must be opened on

 To access the GPS the user must press on the "Current Location" button. From there the 
 user can find their current latitude and longitude by pressing the "Get Location" button. 
 By pressing that button the location services of the app will activate and through that 
 it will use the built in GPS to find the latitude and longitude of the user. After find 
 the user's current lat and long the user can then calculate the sunrise and sunset by 
 pressing on the "Calculate" button. The "Calculate" button is disabled by default until 
 the user has found their current lat and long. For the index, when the user is sent to 
 the table that displays the cities for the specific state they have chosen a index bar on 
 the right side will be present. From there the user can easily navigate the table by 
 pressing on the  letter they wish to jump to.

 There are no bugs in this application.
 Limitations: Like with the app in Assignment 6, the time calculated for sunrise and 
 sunset will be off for states that are not on the west coast.
